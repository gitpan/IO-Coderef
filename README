"IO::Coderef" provides an easy way to produce a phoney read-only filehandle
that calls back to your own code when it needs data to satisfy a read. This
is useful if you want to use a library module that expects to read data from
a filehandle, but you want the data to come from some other source, and
there is too much data to read it all into memory and use IO::String or
similar.

    use IO::Coderef;

    my $fh = IO::Coderef->new('<', sub { ... ; return $data });
    my $object = Some::Class->new_from_file($fh);

Similarly, IO::Coderef allows you to wrap up a coderef as a write-only
filehandle, which you can pass to a library module that expects to write its
output to a filehandle.

    my $fh = IO::Coderef->new('>', sub { my $data = shift ; ... });
    $object->dump_to_file($fh);
